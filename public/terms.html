<p>6.1	In no event will DCE Parties be liable to you for indirect, general, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or other damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, business interruption, corruption of files, loss of business information or any other pecuniary loss). No oral or written information or advice given by DCE Parties or others will create a warranty and neither you nor any third party may rely on any such information or advice. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions and limitations may or may not apply to you.</p>
<p>6.2	You will indemnify and hold DCE Parties harmless with respect to any suits or claims arising out of (i) your breach of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any infringement by you of the copyright or intellectual property rights of any third party; or (ii) your use or misuse of the Site and/or DCE Products.</p>

	<p>We may use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our behalf on our and other websites across the Internet, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to identify your device when you use the Site or DCE Products and to report certain information about your visits to our Site and other websites (such as web pages you visit and your response to ads) in order to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you, both on and off our Site. We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you provide us with consent to do so.</p>
	<p>Other Transfers</p>

<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</p>
	<p>DCE and its Service Providers may disclose Personal Information to applicable US, or other regulatory, government or law enforcement officials, courts or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of DCE or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, fraudulent, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or where required or permitted under applicable US law</p>
<p>Be Careful When You Share Information with Others</p>
	<p>Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available page or any other public forum, others may access that information. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications. You should exercise caution before posting any Personal Information on a public available page.</p>
<p>Exclusions</p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to DCE through the Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and DCE shall be free, and you hereby grant DCE the right, to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>
<p>Security</p>
	<p>We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in an effort to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information in our custody and control. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p>Links</p>
	<p>Our Site may contain links or integrate with other websites and online services. DCE is not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to your use of any third-party website or online service or for the privacy practices of such third parties.

<p>Children’s Privacy</p>
	<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
<p>International Data Transfer</p>
	<p>Please be aware that your Personal Information and communications may be transferred to, stored at, processed and maintained on servers or databases located outside your jurisdiction of residence (such as outside of the United States), including, but not limited to the EEA, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By using this Site, you agree to this transfer, storing and/or processing. 
			We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features in an effort to prevent loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and disclosure.</p>
